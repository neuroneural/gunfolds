# Filer out graphs that have already converged
# ----------------------------------------
# The next two sections are connected and are there to make sure that we do not
# count graphs more than once. Withoutthese sections if a converged or
# oscillating graph matches the measured graph H at multiple undersampling
# rates, all of them will be listed as unique solutions. The main idea is to
# first define a notequal operator, that works by checking individual edges,
# and then filter out solutions where this operator does not hold for at least
# one pair of undersampling rates.

# Turns out that the generating rules above produce all directed edges for each
# undersampling rate from 1 to u in each answer set, but only one set of
# bidirected edges that correspond to the current u in this answer. Often, it
# suffices to check repeatition of all directed edges to determine that a graph
# has converged. The main reason is persistence of bidirected edges that stay
# present once they appear at some undersampling rate. However, in some cases
# the directed edges converge before the bidirected edges do. This happens when
# the final set of directed edges generates at least one bidirected edge at the
# next step.

# The following two lines take advantage of the present history of all directed
# edges across undersampling rates up to u, and build a workaround for the
# absent history of bidirected edges. The first line is true if there was a
# fork with X and Y at the ends before the last step of undersampling. This
# would mean that the bidirected adge, if it exists at the current
# undersampling step, was already there at the last step as well. The second
# line sets notequal to true if at the current undersampling rate L a new
# bidirected edge appeared.
